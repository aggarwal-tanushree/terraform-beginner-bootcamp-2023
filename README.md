## Semantic Versioning

This project is going to use Semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format is: 

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, example: `1.0.1` 

_Note: some projects like to name the versions with a `v` prefix. example: `v1.0.1` . This however is not scematic versioning_

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
